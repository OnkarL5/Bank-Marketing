# Bank-Marketing (Supervised Learning)
In recent times, it has become important to determine how to target customers to make deposits in a bank. It is very diffcult to figure this out by manual labour. There are hundreds of thousands of entries made every single day and quite a lot of factors affecting them. So with the help of Python tools and some Machine Learning algorithms, we try to predict if a customer is going to make a deposit in the bank. 

## Install
This project requires Python 3.6 and the following libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [keras](https://keras.io/)
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Code
Template code is provided in the `Bank-Marketing.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be requires to use the included dataset file `bank-additional.csv`.

### Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Bank-Marketing.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Bank-Marketing.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Dataset information
This dataset was taken from a Portuguese banking institution. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls). The final goal of this is to predict if the customer is going to subscribe to term deposit. 

## Input variables:
### Bank client data:
- age (numeric)
- job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
- marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
- education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
- default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
- housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
- loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
### related with the last contact of the current campaign:
- contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone') 
- month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
- day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
- duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
### other attributes:
- campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
- pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
- previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
- poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')
### social and economic context attributes
- emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
- cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric) 
- cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric) 
- euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
- nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

### Output variable (desired target):
- y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
