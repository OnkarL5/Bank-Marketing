# Bank-Marketing
In recent times, it has become important to determine how to target customers to make deposits in a bank. It is very diffcult to figure this out by manual labour. There are hundreds of thousands of entries made every single day and quite a lot of factors affecting them. So with the help of Python tools and some Machine Learning algorithms, we try to predict if a customer is going to make a deposit in the bank. 

## Models trained on
